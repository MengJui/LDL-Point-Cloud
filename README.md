Lidar (light detection and ranging) is an optical remote-sensing technique that uses laser light to densely sample the surface of the object, producing highly accurate x,y,z measurements. 

In our point cloud database, the data format is PCD file. Each point cloud contains a total of 10,000 points, including x, y and z coordinate data, and all contain corresponding label data.

## About Chaos Lidar 

  Conventional lidars emit repetitive pulses to measure the distance of the target based on the time-of-flight [1]. However, using pulses without any specific patterns makes these lidars vulnerable to interference and malicious jamming [2]. To mitigate these issues, chaos lidars have been proposed and studied which emit non-repetitive chaos-modulated pulses generated by laser intrinsic dynamics [3]. With their noise-like waveforms, the chaos lidars have no range ambiguity and are intrinsically resistant to interference and jamming. The proof-of-concept of chaos lidar was first studied in 2004 [3]. More recently, by utilizing a master oscillation power amplifier scheme to boost its signal-to-noise ratio and using a MEMS mirror for fast beam scanning [4,5], 3D pulsed chaos lidar system that is capable of acquiring point clouds and 3D images of the targets has been demonstrated [6,7]. Benefitted by the broad bandwidths of the chaos waveforms, it has a sub-cm precision in depth that can provide more details of the target for applications of object recognition and detection.

## National Tsing Hua University Laser dynamics lab

The laser dynamics lab was established in 2004. We specialized in nonlinear dynamics of semiconductor lasers and their novel applications. Both simulations and experiments are being developed and studied. Our research interests include 3D chaos lidar, diverse waveform generation using laser dynamics, laser-based ultra-wideband (UWB) radar, UWB microwave imaging and communications, target identifications, and penetration detections. Beyond the academic merits, these technologies are highly related and demanded by the industries.

Since 2016, our group focus on the development of the 3D Chaos Lidar System for applications of autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, 3D modelling, localization and recognition. By utilizing the unique properties of broadband chaos modulated pulses, the unprecedented chaos lidar system not only has millimeter precision in ranging but also immune to interference and jamming.
